# Google Photos Library API Samples

This repository contains a sample for the [Google Photos Library API](https://developers.google.com/photos).

The Library API lets you read, write and share photos & videos in Google Photos.

## Samples

The [REST/Photoframe](REST/PhotoFrame/README.md) sample shows how to use the REST API in a Node.JS web application to build an interactive photo frame that loads
photos from a user's Google Photos library. It is built with express.js.

### Running the samples
Follow the README for the [REST/Photoframe](REST/PhotoFrame/README.md) sample for steps on how to get started.
